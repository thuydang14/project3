# Instruction 

Sparkify is a digital music service similar to Spotify and YouTube Music. Users may subscribe, listen to their favorite music for free (ads included) or for a fee, add friends or songs to their playlists, and so on.

In this project, we will use Spark to modify massive and realistic datasets in order to create important characteristics for forecasting churn. We will develop machine learning models with huge datasets using Spark MLlib.
